## Assessment_Plan

### Ganglion cyst, left ankle

Palpable cystic mass consistent with ganglion cyst. Similar to previous presentation on wrist.

Plan:
1. Order ultrasound of left ankle to confirm diagnosis
2. Discuss treatment options: observation vs. aspiration vs. surgical excision
3. If patient desires intervention, refer to orthopedics

### Diabetic peripheral neuropathy with foot involvement

Progressive neuropathy of left foot. Currently managed with Neurontin, but symptoms progressing.

Plan:
1. Increase Neurontin to 600mg three times daily
2. Reinforce importance of diabetic foot care
3. Consider referral to podiatry for specialized diabetic foot evaluation
4. Assess glycemic control - order HbA1c

### Diabetes mellitus, Type 2

Currently on Glucophage (metformin). Patient reports good medication compliance.

Plan:
1. Continue Glucophage 1000mg BID
2. Order HbA1c to assess control
3. Recheck fasting glucose
4. Continue with long-term oral hypoglycemic therapy

### Hypertension

Well controlled. Continue current regimen.
